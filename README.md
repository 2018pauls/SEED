# SEED
This Project is all about creating a robot that will be able to move around a certain amount of markers within a certain amount of space. This will be done over a span of four projects, each one building on the last. Each project has its own branch of the repository, that way the code for the projects are organized. We start off with the mini project and learn how to control the motor, use the camera, and get the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi communicating with each other. For Demo 1, we are now actually building the robot and having the components used in the last part attached to the robot. The robot is then to perform the tasks as seen on the project board. Demo 2 builds even more on Demo 1. The first trial for the robot is to see a beacon using the camera and then move to one foot in front of the beacon. The second trial will have the robot move to one foot in front of the beacon and then circle the beacon and come to a stop. The Final Demo and the whole goal of the course is to have the robot move around a set of seven beacons within a foot and a half range from the beacons.
