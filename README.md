This part of the project has us building the robot and programming it. The first part of this uses the camera to measure the angle between it and the beacon. It then reports that angle out on the LCD screen. The next part of this project is to have the robot move forward a specified amount of feet. The final part has the robot move a certain angle and then move one foot forward.
